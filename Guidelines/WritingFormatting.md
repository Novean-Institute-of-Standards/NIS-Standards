## SIP Formatting

### Terms
 
 Each SIP (depending on the type) will have at least one of the following parts:
 
- **Preamble** - A header containing meta-data about the SIP, including the SIP number, a short descriptive title, the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.
 
- **Abstract** - a short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.
 
- **Specification** - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new standard proposal. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for a complete understanding by impacted parties.
 
- **Motivation** -- The motivation is critical for SIPs. It should clearly explain why the existing standards specification are inadequate to address the problem that the SIP solves. SIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected.
 
- **Rationale** - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the standards change and why particular decisions were made. It may also describe alternate ideas that were considered. Ideally it should provide evidence of consensus within the standards community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
 
- **Reference Text** - The reference standards text to be added or changed should accompany all SIPs. Any SIP that does not contain a reference text will be rejected.

**Submission**

An errata SIP may be submitted directly to the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Novean-Institute-of-Standards/NIS-Standards) without needing to go through a standards partners approval process. 

If it is determined that the scope of the SIP is beyond an errata change, it may be rejected and sent back for escalation as one of the other SIP types.
