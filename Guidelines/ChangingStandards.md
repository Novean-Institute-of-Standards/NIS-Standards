## What is a SIP?

SIP stands for Standards Improvement Proposal. A SIP is a design document providing information to NIS describing a new standard, recommendation, or a change to an existing standard. The SIP should provide a concise specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

SIPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new standards, for collecting input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into the NIS Standards. The SIP author is responsible for building consensus and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because standards are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the NIS Standards.

## SIP Types

The following is a brief outline of the various types of SIPs, however each will be covered in full detail in their respective sections.

- **Fundamentals SIP** - Will cover a standards proposal that will be required fundamental knowledge for all users impacted. If a Fundamentals SIP is accepted, a grace period will be enacted so that users can train and/or adapt to the changes as needed. 

  An example of a Fundamentals SIP would be the usage of UTC as the base time, in which all traffic controllers and pilots would need to be adapt to communicating only in UTC time. 
  
- **Recommendation SIP** - Will cover a standards proposal for non-binding guidance or best practice recommendations. If a Recommendation SIP is accepted, it's not expected that any parties adhere to it, though it's understood that following it may lead to a better experience for impacted users.

  An example of a Recommendation SIP would be using Illuminated Voxels in a specific pattern on a landing pad to denote nearby amenities for specific ship classes. While not necessary, it may improve the pilot landing experience.
